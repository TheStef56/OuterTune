Version 0.9.3

## New features
• Added support for track and disk number for local songs. Support for sorting by track number in folders screen
• Added sorting by date modified and date released for local playlists. (Date modified and date released are only supported for local songs)
• Sort preference for folder screen is now separate from song screens
• Added M3U export for folders
• Light theme in player screen for blur/gradient backgrounds


## Changes and improvements
• Queues can now be renamed
• Adding a song to an existing queue now turns it into an extension queue (a queue with a "+" symbol at the end). Previously this would create a new copy of the queue
• Removed popup fab on most screens, moved functionality into menu
• Add fallback images for songs without artwork
• Improve shuffle and repeat button readability by using different icons instead of darker/lighter colours
• Improve player sheet artwork padding on smaller screens
• Adjust bottom sheet transition to be slower but smoother
• Better landscape split•screen ui usability for phone screens
• Improve Karaoke lyrics display
• Karaoke lyrics are no longer an experimental feature. The setting has been moved to the advanced pane of lyrics settings
• Updated translations
• General optimizations, improvements, and fixes


## Bug fixes
• Artwork does not show for local albums (You likely need to run the local media scanner with "rescan" enabled to see effects)
• Fix artwork not displaying for playlists with local songs
• Fixed crash: "IllegalArgumentException: cannot use a recycled source in createBitmap"
• File size for local songs are shown to be slightly smaller than they should be
